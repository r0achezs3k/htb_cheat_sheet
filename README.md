# 🐱‍💻 r0achezsEk's Hack The Box Essentials

Welcome to **r0achezsEk's Hack The Box Essentials**, a collection of files I've commonly found myself reaching for during Hack The Box machines. Instead of hunting them down over and over again, I decided to gather them all in one place—organized and ready for quick access.

## 📂 What's in the Repo?

This repository contains:
- **Tools**: Scripts and binaries I often use during pentests.
- **Payloads**: Ready-to-go payloads for testing exploits.
- **Cheatsheets**: Handy references for quick lookup.
- **Configurations**: Custom config files that help with tunneling, proxies, or privilege escalation.

## 🧰 Why I Built This Repo?

After running into the same files and scripts during Hack The Box challenges, I figured it would save time (and sanity) to have everything in one place. If you're like me, and you're always digging through your directories or searching the web for that *one file*, then this repo should help streamline your workflow.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

I plan to keep adding more files as I continue to explore different machines. This repo will grow with new tools, scripts, and configurations as I encounter them. Stay tuned!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All tools and files are to be used **ethically and legally**. This repository is strictly for **educational purposes** and should be used in controlled environments (CTFs, Hack The Box, etc.). Always get permission before testing or hacking anything that isn’t yours.

Feel free to clone, fork, or contribute if you have more useful files that can help in hacking/pentesting environments! 👾
